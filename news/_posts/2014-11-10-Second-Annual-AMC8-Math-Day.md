For the second year in a row, Marija is organizing the Greenfield Math Day in Albert Greenfield Elementary School in Center City, Philadelphia, to be held on November 18, 2014. 
(Any interested parents or children from other local schools interested to participate are welcome to contact Marija). 
Last year, the whole middle school consisting of about 200 students participated.
The AMC8 is an international competition consisting of 25 multiple-choice questions and students have 40 minutes to work on it initiated by the Mathematical Association of America  (MAA). 
MAA encourages all students in grades 6, 7 and 8 to participate in the AMC 8. 
All USA, USA embassy, Canadian and foreign school students in grade 8 or below are eligible to participate. 
Especially talented students as young as 8 years old have participated in the past.
