Prof. Marija Drndić has been chosen as a Penn Fellow for the next two years.
The Penn Fellows program is designed to provide a select group of developing campus leaders with an opportunity to build University-wide networks, think strategically about higher education, and learn more about Penn and its programs by interacting informally with members of the University’s executive team.

Information about the current Fellows is listed at [provost.upenn.edu/penn-fellows](http://provost.upenn.edu/penn-fellows).
