New research from our group on graphene nanopores was published in Nano Letters. 
Our paper, [DNA translocation through graphene nanopores](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl101046t), demonstrates DNA translocation through synthetic nanopore materials with atomic thickness and electrical addressability, which may serve as a step toward nanopore-based DNA sequencing.
We envision graphene-based nanopore devices that sense and control the electric potential locally at the nanopore and are capable of measuring transverse current across the pore aperture.
