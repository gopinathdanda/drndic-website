Our new paper, ["Rapid electronic detection of probe-specific microRNAs using thin nanopore sensors"](http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2010.202.html), published in Nature Nanotechnology and featured on the journal cover page, develops a platform for electronic detection of probe-hybridized microRNAs. 
We find that reducing the thickness of the membrane containing the nanopore leads to increased signal amplitudes from biomolecules, and reducing the diameter of the nanopore allows the detection and discrimination of small nucleic acids based on differences in their physical dimensions. 
The work was done in collaboration with New England Biolabs.
