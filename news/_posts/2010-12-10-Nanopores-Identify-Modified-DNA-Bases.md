In our most recent paper, ["Discrimination of methylcytosine from hydroxymethylcytosine in DNA molecules"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja107836t), we investigate the physical properties of DNA with modified cytosines. 
Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that polar cytosine modifications affect internal base pair dynamics, while experimental evidence suggests a correlation between the modified cytosine's polarity, DNA flexibility, and duplex stability. 
On the basis of these physical differences, solid-state nanopores can rapidly discriminate among DNA fragments with mC or hmC modification by sampling a few hundred molecules in the solution.
