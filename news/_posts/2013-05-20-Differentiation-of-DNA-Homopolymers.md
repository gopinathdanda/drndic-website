In a recent ACS Nano paper, ["Differentiation of Short, Single-Stranded DNA Homopolymers in Solid-State Nanopores"](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn4014388), we show that small solid-state nanopores similar in size to protein nanopores, combined with an optimized setup, can differentiate between single-stranded DNA homopolymers (with A, C, and T bases).
