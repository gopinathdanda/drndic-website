Graduate student Lauren Willis used high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to image gold particles attached to peptides wrapped around individual single wall nantubes (SWNTs), which allowed quantitative analysis of particle spacing and configuration to confirm the computational model of the complex. 
This paper, [Computational Design of Virus-Like Protein Assemblies on Carbon Nanotube Surfaces](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1071), was selected for the [cover of Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6033/1005.1).
