Undergraduate student Bart Machielse was [selected](https://mpc-www.mit.edu/component/k2/item/532-12-summer-scholars-selected) as one of twelve MIT summer scholars
from June 7 to August 8, 2015. Bart was chosen among 156 applicants.

University of Pennsylania junior physics major Bartholomeus Machielse says, "I'm looking forward to meeting scientists from around the country and to experiencing the unique research environment that MIT offers, while continuing to develop the skills I'll need to one day run my own lab." Machielse was lead co-author of "Improving Signal-to-Noise Performance for DNA Translocation in Solid-State Nanopores at MHz Bandwidths" (Nano Letters, Nov. 21, 2014) under Prof. Marija DrndiÄ‡, Professor of Physics at Penn.
