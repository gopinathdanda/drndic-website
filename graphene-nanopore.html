	<a name="Introduction"><font size=+1>S</font>olid state<a href="#1" class="ref">1-8</a> and 
	biological<a href="#9" class="ref">9</a> nanopores are proving to be invaluable tools for 
	probing single-molecules.  A nanopore is a small hole that connects two chambers that contain 
	electrolyte solution. An applied voltage across the nanopore drives ions through the pore, which 
	is recorded from the voltage source using a high-gain amplifier. DNA molecules, added to the 
	electrolyte solution, can then be driven single file through such nanopores by the electric 
	field<a href="#9" class="ref">9</a> .  As the molecules translocate they partially block ion 
	flow through the pore, detected as a drop in the measured current.  Electronically monitoring 
	the process of DNA translocation has been proposed as a low-cost, high-throughput DNA 
	sequencing technique.<a href="#9" class="ref">9</a>  Recently, the four DNA bases were shown 
	to impede the ion current differently in a biological pore<a href="#10" class="ref">10,11</a>, and other theoretical and 
	experimental works suggest that the four bases can be discriminated by measuring their 
	transverse conductance<a href="#12" class="ref">12-14</a>.  In light of these works, synthetic 
	nanopore materials with atomic thickness and electrical addressability may serve as a step 
	toward nanopore-based DNA sequencing.  Common membrane materials currently used for nanopore 
	device fabrication are insulators such as silicon nitride<a href="#15" class="ref">15</a> (SiN), 
	aluminum oxide<a href="#16" class="ref">16</a>, and silicon oxide<a href="#15" class="ref">17</a> (SiO<sub>2</sub>).  
	Graphene is a thin, flexible material with good electronic conductivity and robust mechanical 
	properties<a href="#18" class="ref">18-21</a>.  <br><br>

	In 2008, we have shown<a href="#22" class="ref">22<a> that nanopores, 
	nanopore arrays, and other structures, can be fabricated in suspended graphene sheets by 
	controlled electron-beam exposure in a transmission electron microscope (TEM).  Despite the 
	extreme thinness of the suspended graphene sheets, nanopores were structurally robust and 
	their shape was stable over time.  Use of graphene as a nanopore membrane material could 
	permit sensing and control of the electric potential directly at the nanopore.  Additionally, 
	atomically thin graphene nanoelectrodes have been considered for DNA sequencing based on DNA's 
	transverse conductance<a href="#13" class="ref">13</a> and multilayer graphene-insulator devices 
	could control the molecule's motion sufficiently to reliably measure the conductance of each 
	consecutive nucleotide<a href="#23" class="ref">23,24</a>.  Despite these possibilities, the 
	interactions between graphene nanopores and biomolecules in aqueous solution have yet to be explored.<br><br>

	Recently, we have realized the first experimental realization of DNA translocation through graphene 
	nanopores, which is the first step towards exploring the potential applications of this new membrane 
	material.  We showed that the ionic blocked current signatures from DNA translocations through sub 10-nm 
	diameter graphene nanopores compare favorably with similar diameter SiN nanopores.  However, we also 
	observed that the current signal from bare graphene nanopores is noisier than for SiN nanopores, and the 
	DNA translocation signals reveal non-uniform current amplitudes.  This noise is attributed to the presence 
	of pinholes in some of our graphene membranes as well as incomplete wetting of the membranes. <br><br>

	We also found that atomic layer deposition (ALD) of several nanometers of titanium dioxide over the 
	devices consistently reduces the nanopore noise level and improves the mechanical robustness of the 
	device.  This process preserves electrical addressability of the nanopore, which may be useful for 
	realizing both multilayer graphene-insulator nanopores<a href="#23" class="ref">23,24<a> and graphene 
	nanogap devices<a href="#13" class="ref">13</a>.

	<font size=-1><b>Figure 1</b> Graphene nanopore devices. (a) Device schematic. Few-layer 
	graphene (1-5 nm thick) is suspended over a 1 &mu;m hole in a 40 nm thick silicon nitride (SiN) 
	membrane. The SiN membrane is suspended over an approx. 50 x 50 &mu;m<sup>2</sup> aperture in a silicon chip 
	coated with a 5 &mu;m SiO<sub>2</sub> layer. The device is inserted into a PDMS measurement cell with microfluidic 
	channels that form reservoirs in contact with either side of the chip. A bias voltage, V<sub>B</sub>, 
	is applied between the reservoirs to drive DNA through the nanopore.  (b) TEM image of a nanopore 
	in a graphene membrane.  Scale bar is 10 nm.  (c) Ionic current-voltage measurement for this 10-nm 
	graphene nanopore device in 1M KCl, pH 9.</font><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

	A schematic of a typical graphene nanopore device is given in Figure 1a.  Silicon chips covered with
	5-&mu;m SiO<sub>2</sub> and 40 nm silicon nitride are etched so that freestanding nitride membranes 
	of approximately 50 &mu;m square remain.  Electron beam lithography (EBL) followed by an SF<sub>6</sub> 
	plasma etch is used to pattern a ~1-&mu;m hole through the nitride membrane.  Graphene is grown by the 
	chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of methane over polished copper foils<a href="#25" class="ref">25</a>. 
	The copper foils are etched in solution so that bare graphene sheets, approximately 1-5 nm thick (3-15 
	monolayers), float on the surface of the liquid.  Suitably-sized graphene sheets, larger than 2 mm &times; 
	2 mm, are then scooped onto the pre-patterned silicon nitride membranes.  In this way the graphene is 				structurally supported by the nitride membrane, with only a limited area freely suspended over the 
	1-&mu;m hole.  Nanopores are then drilled through the suspended graphene membranes by transmission 
	electron beam ablation lithography<a href="#26" class="ref">26</a> (TEBAL). We have used CVD graphene, 
	rather than exfoliated, because the cm-scale sheets are easy to manipulate and the process is scalable 
	for future applications.  It has been observed that CVD graphene is very hydrophobic<a href="#27" 
	class="ref">27</a>, and we have found that a rapid UV/ozone treatment facilitates complete wetting of the 
	graphene nanopores.  All devices underwent at least five minutes of UV/ozone treatment immediately 
	prior to assembly in a PDMS measurement cell and exposure to electrolyte.  Our measurement cell has 
	microfluidic channels that form reservoirs in contact with either side of the chip.  Using a pair of Ag/AgCl 
	electrodes, a bias voltage, V<sub>B</sub>, is applied between the two reservoirs to drive ionic current 
	through the nanopore.<br><br>

	A TEM image of a representative nanopore drilled into a suspended graphene membrane is given in Figure 1b.  
	The visible rings around the pore are from graphene layers, and their number provides an estimate of the 
	graphene membrane thickness<a href="#21" class="ref">21,28</a>.  Figure 1c shows a typical measurement of 
	the ionic current through a graphene nanopore as a function of the applied voltage, V<sub>B</sub>.

	<font size=+1>A</font> TEM image of an 8-nm graphene nanopore, along with a current trace showing DNA 
	translocation through the nanopore device, is given in Figures 2a and 2b.  The electrolyte solution used 
	for these measurements was 1 M KCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 9.  We added 15 kbp double-stranded DNA 
	(Fermentas NoLimits&#174;, Glen Burnie, MD) at a concentration of 1 nM to the analyte reservoir, and applied 
	a bias voltage of V<sub>B</sub> = +100 mV to the other reservoir in order to drive DNA through the pore. 
	The ionic current signal was filtered with a 10 kHz 3-pole Bessel filter and then sampled at 50 kHz. 
	We see that the 28 nA open pore current sharply decreases by between ~ 500 pA and 1 nA as DNA molecules 
	pass through the graphene nanopore. Translocation events are not observed before the addition of DNA 
	molecules.  The overall noise level is much higher for this device than for silicon nitride nanopore 
	devices we have measured, but the DNA capture rate is comparable for both nanopores (~1 event/s for 1nM 
	and V<sub>B</sub> = 100 mV).  The graphene nanopore noise is dominated by a 1/f noise component, which will be 	discussed later.<br><br>

	A histogram of the measured blocked current signal, I<sub>BL</sub>, is shown in Figure 2c for the device 
	shown in Figure 2a. Here, I<sub>BL</sub> is defined as I<sub>BL</sub> = &lt;I&gt; - &lt;I<sub>open</sub>&gt;, 
	where &lt;I&gt; is the mean pore current during DNA translocation and &lt;I<sub>open</sub>&gt; is the mean 
	pore current 0.1 ms before DNA entry. The data in Figure 2c has been fit with a double Gaussian with mean 
	I<sub>BL</sub> values of 0.45 and 0.9.  These mean values correspond to peaks in the histogram of the current 
	data, and indicate two event populations.  Examples of both populations are represented in the inset by 
	several representative events.  From these events we see that both folded and unfolded events comprise the 
	two populations.  The blocked current fraction (i.e., &lt;I<sub>BL</sub>&gt;/&lt;I<sub>open</sub>&gt) is 
	~ 5 times smaller than expected based on the relative areas of the DNA molecule (ADNA) and the nanopore32 (Ap). 
	We calculate an expected value of ADNA/Ap ~ (2.2 nm)2/(8 nm)2 = 7.6%, compared with a measured blocked current 
	fraction of 1.6%.<br><br>

	A scatter plot of event depth as a function of event length for ~ 600 events measured with the same device 
	is given in Figure 2d.  Two clear groupings of events are visible, one centered on IBL ~ 0.5 nA (unfolded) 
	and a second centered on ~ 1 nA (folded).  A histogram of the measured event lengths for these events is 
	given in Figure 2e.  There is a large variation in the measured event lengths with no clear average value, 
	indicating that the peak value is likely just below the measurement threshold.  Two clear populations of 
	events are observed and have been fit with exponential functions<a href="#8" class="ref">8,32</a> using time 
	constants of &tau;1 = 0.1 ms and &tau;2 = 0.5 ms. These timescales correspond to an average DNA velocity of 
	between ~ 5 and 30 ns/basepair, comparable to DNA velocities through other nanopore materials<a href="#34" 
	class="ref">34</a>. <br><br>

	Our current work focuses on improving the overall reliability of these devices and on utilizing the 
	conductivity of the graphene sheet to create devices for probing DNA molecules.  We envision graphene-based 
	nanopore devices that sense and control the electric potential locally at the nanopore and are capable 
	of measuring transverse current across the pore aperture.
